HorizontalRuler
A simple Java program that creates a horizontal ruler or divider using recursion. This program is ideal for separating content or adding visual structure to command-line interfaces.

Programming technique in this code
The drawing functionality uses recursion to build the ruler character by character, a unique method that demonstrates recursive function calls in Java. This approach can be beneficial for understanding recursive patterns and structures in simple applications.

Features
Customizable Length: Easily adjust the length of the ruler.
Recursive Drawing: Uses recursion to draw the ruler line, demonstrating a recursive approach in Java.
Simple Character Pattern: The ruler is composed of repeating characters for simplicity.
Reusable Code: Easy to integrate into other Java projects.
